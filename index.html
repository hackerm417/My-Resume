    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a student age 17 recently completed my class
         12th and I live in Southwest Delhi,India to spend 
         my leisure time of around 3-4months I am learning 
         Full Stack Web Development from the course I bought
        online Well The main thing that I should tell first
        is that My name is Yash saini from starting my 
        interest are on doing something practical but
        as the education system are only value the 
        theory actually I don't like I want to make
        things that are useful for human community
        without disturbing the environment I alway
        think to make the iron man suit for the military purp
        ose if I can or the A.I. jarvis shown in the movie
        but now I can't make everything but something where
        are interest like A.I. , machine learning and all
        things related to computer It felt so calm and
        good when I make a website or write a code At 
        the begining  I am very confused where to start 
        but I just push myself to just jump on the track
        and get started in the world of computer now I
        am very happy to see myself upgrading day by
        day and learning something.Actually I personally don't 
        think it is a summary I don't know what I typed down in
        flow but okay I just want to let you know I love computers 
        and their functions so I want to learn them and 
        master it.
