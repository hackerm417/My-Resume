<h2>About My Life </h2>
My life is kinda boring as I have no friends and my only 
sister left this world 7 months ago so nobody to talk to
just me and my parents I felt so lonely that I try myself
 to be busy in activites and learning something new and 
developing myself Actually It's very hard for me to just 
cope up with these things and I don't understand why people 
are jealous of me.My life at starting are very good I am having fun all the time just care about me and my sister and playing together fighting and all that school life was also good till 3rd standard and then everything messed up.I  started getting bullies in new school and become a introvert.
but I always remember a line about myself that <br> "<b>It takes nothing to stand in a group but It takes a lot to stand alone</b>  "
